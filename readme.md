## About
This program is used to close all open programs in Hyprland while the programs can still warn the user about unsaved changes. If hyprland is just quit then changes will be lost
Currently, the hyprclose will only close open windows. It doesn't handle tray programs, which I might add in the future

## Building
to build this, just run this command:
```bash
cargo build -r
```
This will build the optimized version of hyprclose
